# ðŸ“± Twilio Interactive Voice Response 

Instead of just giving out my contact number, I used Twilio to create creative and interactive way to get in touch with me. When the twilio webhook is hit, the caller is prompted with 4 options to chose from: 
	 1. Speak with me
	 2. Leave a voicemail
	 3. Receive a link to my schedule through text
	 4. Receive a random compliment through text
